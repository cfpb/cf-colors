# :warning: THIS REPO IS DEPRECATED (4/23/2015) :warning:
Please migrate to using [cf-core](https://github.com/cfpb/cf-core) which contains all of the same color variables.

# cf-colors

Less color variables for the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://cfpb.github.io/)
color palette.
This component can be used by itself, but it was made for Capital Framework,
a new front end framework developed at the
[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://cfpb.github.io/).

If you would like to take advantage of more components or if you're new to
Capital Framework, we encourage you to [start here](https://cfpb.github.io/capital-framework/).
